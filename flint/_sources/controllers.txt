Controllers
=================================================

Controllers are where your request-response cycles begin and end. A route is matched to a controller, and a method on that controller, and dispatched through. Controllers in Flint are actually all **Controller Services**, a Silex and Symfony concept where each controller is defined as a regular service, with some special magic (specifically, appending ``.controller`` to the service name, and making it ``share()``-ed so it's a singleton). See the usage documentation at `Silex's documentation site <silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers/service_controller.html>`_, and how to define them in Flint below.

Syntax For ``app/controllers.php``
===============================

.. literalinclude:: code/app/controllers.php
    :language: php
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 2,6

This config file shows how a controller is defined, named ``example``, which will be accessed in the routes by ``example.controller``. It uses a callback to define the controller: this will allow you to bring in services easily.

Injecting A Service
==================

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 2,8,11

    <?php
    use FlintExample\ExampleApp,
        FlintExample\Controller\ExampleController;

    return [
        'example' => function() {
            // Retrieve the service named 'Hello' from the DI container
            $hello = ExampleApp::getInstance()['Hello'];

            // Inject it into the controller
            return new ExampleController($hello);
        }
    ];
